PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY Full Stack Developer with 4+ years of experience delivering high-performance web applications using React, Node.js, Redis, and Docker, scalable microservices, SSR, caching, and DevOps pipelines.
PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE Software Engineer | Mr. Cooper, Austin, Texas February 2025 - Present ● Led team in developing modular React boilerplates for monthly marketing pages, reducing time by 70%. ● Integrated LivePerson chat into Next.js marketing pages using GCP Blob for dynamic configs and Google Tag Manager for event tracking and UTM-based campaign attribution, boosting conversion by 15%.
Software Engineer - II | Mr. Cooper, India April 2022 - September 2023 ● Reduced application bundle size by 15% through tree shaking and React component optimization. ● Built middleware to log user interactions and store them in Redis; the data was later used in A/B testing, which showed a 30% improvement in conversion rate.
Key Project: Banner Development Automation - Banner Assets | Mr. Cooper ● Spearheaded Node.js microservice to generate dynamic banner templates, integrating with Rails and React using structured Embed Ruby-based layout mapping, replacing 10+ hardcoded templates. ● Automated deployment with Azure Pipelines, containerized builds with Kubernetes, and orchestrated GCP Blob uploads, reducing release efforts by 90%.
Software Engineer - I | Mr. Cooper, India January 2021 - April 2022 ● Collaborated in the Dockerized internal idea-sharing platform using React.js, Redux, Node.js, and MongoDB, scaling the application to handle over 10,000 monthly web requests with optimized API response times and aggregation Azure pipelines. ● Engineered an async middleware pipeline in Node.js and Next.js to handle SSR page-level logic and redirects, replacing third-party and reducing cold-start latency by 35% across dynamic routes.
Key Project: Scheduled API Caching Service | Mr. Cooper ● Constructed a Node.js microservice scheduled via Azure Pipelines to prefetch API responses, decreasing upstream dependency and reducing real-time network load. ● Integrated Redis caching to bypass redundant API calls, lowering network traffic by 60% and stabilizing response time under high load.
Software Engineer - Trainee & Intern | Mr. Cooper, India January 2020 - January 2021 ● Tested 100+ React components using Mocha, Enzyme, RTL, and Selenium, reducing regression bugs by 30%. ● Revamped 70 web pages to meet ADA compliance using WAI-ARIA standards, improving accessibility and resulting in annual cost savings of up to 350K USD.

TECHNICAL PROJECTS: Cloud Logging using Hyperledger (Grad Project- Cloud Computing) January 2025 - March 2025 ● Led a Grad project on Kubernetes-based cloud logging system using Redis Pub/Sub and Hyperledger Fabric (GO chaincode) to enable real-time ingestion and tamper-proof logging. ● Integrated Grafana for unified monitoring, improving log traceability, reliability, and audit-readiness across distributed cloud workloads. Air Pollution Prediction Web App April 2016 - September 2016 ● Built a machine learning model using XGBoost to predict PM10 air pollution levels from real-world environmental datasets. Developed a Flask-based web application with live PM10 forecasting and interactive data visualizations. ● Optimized model performance by hyperparameter tuning and integrated location-based prediction APIs. Selected for research publication, showcasing practical applications of AI for public health awareness. EDUCATION Masters of Computer Engineering, University of California, Riverside September 2023 - March 2025 Bachelor of Computer Science and Engineering, Anna University, India August 2016 - April 2020.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Awarded “Challenger of Mr.Cooper - Q4 2022” for leading automation of banner templates and mentoring interns in component development, problem-solving, testing, and deployment.
